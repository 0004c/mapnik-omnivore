<desc><![CDATA[The Mountain Bike Loop at the Middlesex Fells.
Being so close to Boston, the Fells is a popular place to ride.  Unfortunately, irresponsible mountain bike use has resulted in lots of erosion and the closure of most of the reservation to mountain bikes.  Bikes are restricted to the Mountain Bike Loop, and doubletrack (fire-roads) on the West side of Interstate 93.
If you ride the Fells, ride legally and during off-peak hours, and encourage others to do the same.
